# STM32F103C8T6-Bluepill
This repository is a collection of few basic projects on done on the ARM Cortex M3 based STM32F103C8T6 board popularly known as bluepill.
You will get examples for bare metal programming approach towards microcontrollers.
I have added relevant comments to describe what each line(s) of code is for. This also makes undrestanding the execution flow easier.
