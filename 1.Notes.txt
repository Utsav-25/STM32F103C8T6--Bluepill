Bare Metal STm32 programming:

1. INITIALISING the Clock for CUP, Core and other peripherals.
We need to initialise the clock, clock sources, PLL configuration 
so that the required clock signal if fed to the CPU and other peripherals.

1. Enable the HSE(High speed External source, usually Xtal) and wait for it to become stable
2. Configure the flash prefetch and latency settings 
(this is required because at high spped clock operation, we need to make user the flash 
memory can support such speeds)
3. Configure the clock for busses (AHB, APB1, APB2)
4. Configure the PLL multiplier/ HSE divider
5. Enable the PLL source and wait for it to become stable
6. Enable the clock source and wait for it to set

Note: All the configuration needs to be done before enabling the PLL clock source ( point 5 and 6) because after enabling the PLL, no configuration changes can be made.
