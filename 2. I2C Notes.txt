I2C in STM32F103

We will be using Master transmitter and master receiver mode

We will be using PB10 and PB11 as our SDL2 and SDA2, utilizing the I2C 2 peripheral

The first steps are:
1. Enable the clock on GPIO, I2C peripheral and also the clock for alternate function.
2. Configure the 2 pins PB10 and PB11 as alternate function open drain (open drain because we will be sending as well are receiving data) 
3. Configure the CFreq or clock frequency on the I2C CR2 register. We are using 32 Mhz so value - 0x20 in hex
4. Configure the clock control register (CCR) to generate the clock for SCL pin ( we will generate 50Khz)
5. Configure the I2C TRise register to configure the rise time of SCL. Max rise time can be 1000ns
	Calculation: Trise = 1000/ (1/fclk) = 1000 / (1/32) = 32
	So Trise value =33 (which is 0x21 in hex)
